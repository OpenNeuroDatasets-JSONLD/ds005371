[Osprey Documentation](https://schorschinho.github.io/osprey)

Osprey is an all-in-one software suite for state-of-the art processing and
quantitative analysis of in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data.

### Features
- 1-file job definition system for reproducible data analysis
- Automated recognition of input file format and sequence origin
- Fully-automated loading and pre-processing pipeline for optimal SNR, linewidth, phasing, and alignment
- Integrated linear-combination modeling module
- Full density-matrix simulated basis sets (using real pulses and sequence timings; including effects of localization and spectral editing) for many metabolites and common sequence implementations
- Functions to create custom basis sets and import basis sets from LCModel or Tarquin
- Integrated voxel co-registration and segmentation module (requires SPM12)
- Quantification based on tissue fractions and (customizable) metabolite/tissue water relaxation times
- GUI to display data, quality assessment, and quantitative results at each step of the analysis
- Rich 'Overview' GUI panel for batched datasets to visualize distributions of metabolite estimates and mean +/- SD spectra

### Supported methods
- Conventional MRS (STEAM, PRESS, semi-LASER, LASER)
- MEGA editing
- Hadamard-encoded editing (HERMES, HERCULES)
- Dual voxel (PRIAM)

### Supported sequence implementations
- Philips (Philips product sequences; Johns Hopkins patches)
- Siemens (Siemens product and WIP sequences; Johns Hopkins patches; CMRR sequences; Jamie Near sequence)
- GE (GE product sequences; Ralph Noeske sequence)

### Supported file formats
- Philips: SDAT/SPAR, DATA/LIST, SIN/LAB/RAW (coming soon)
- Siemens: TWIX/DAT, RDA (single- & multi-file), DICOM (DCM/IMA, single- & multi-file)
- GE: P

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Osprey requires [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and
has been tested on version 2017a and newer. The following toolboxes are
required for full functionality:

- Optimization
- Statistics and Machine Learning

### Installation

Download the latest **Osprey** code from its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey), then extract and add the
entire folder (with subfolders) to your MATLAB path. Make sure to regularly
check for updates, as we frequently commit new features, bug fixes, and improved
functions.

To perform voxel co-registration and tissue segmentation, download **SPM12**
[from the UCL website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/), then
extract and add to your MATLAB path. If you run an Apple Silicon processor 
(M1 and later), please download the [SPM development version from GitHub](https://github.com/spm/spm).

If you want to use the `Osprey` Graphical User Interface (GUI),
please download the following toolboxes from the MATLAB File Exchange:

- [GUI Layout Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox)
      (David Sampson)

- [Widget Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66235-widgets-toolbox)
      (Robin Jackey)

Download both toolboxes in the MATLAB toolbox format (.mltbx). You can
double-click to install. MATLAB will automatically add the toolboxes to its
path.

Make sure to remove FID-A and Gannet from your MATLAB path.

## Contact, Feedback, Suggestions

To report bugs and problems or to request features, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey/issues).

For all other questions, feedback, suggestions, or critique, please visit either:

- the [GitHub Discussions forum in this repository](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey/discussions) or
- the [Osprey support forum](https://forum.mrshub.org/c/mrs-software/osprey/10) on the [MRSHub](https://www.mrshub.org), if you think your question is of significance to the wider community.

We also welcome your direct contributions to Osprey here in the GitHub repository.
